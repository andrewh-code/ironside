1. Calculate the 50/200 day moving average
- doesn't seem like you can get historical moving averag data (or any other data other than open, close, high, low, adj close)
- YQL vs. CSV (better to use YQL)

- retrieve the historical data from YQL
- based on the start date and the end date
- retrieve the adjusted closing data
- calculate the moving average (50 and 200). Use numpy python library for mathematical computations.
- output the array/list
